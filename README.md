## Vision

The HomeworkGrader smart contract provides a decentralized solution for grading and rewarding homework submissions. By leveraging Ethereum's blockchain, this contract ensures transparency and fairness in the grading process. Students can submit their homework, receive grades, and get rewarded automatically based on their performance, while the contract owner manages and oversees the grading and fund distribution.

## Flowchart

1. **Student Submission**:
   - **Function**: `submitHomework`
   - Students submit their homework answers.
   - The contract records the submission details with a timestamp.

2. **Grading and Rewarding**:
   - **Function**: `gradeHomework`
   - The contract owner grades the homework and calculates the reward based on the grade and a predefined multiplier.
   - The reward is transferred to the student's address.

3. **Ownership Management**:
   - **Function**: `transferOwnership`
   - The contract owner can transfer ownership to a new address.

4. **Funds Management**:
   - **Function**: `withdrawFunds`
   - The owner can withdraw funds from the contract's balance.

## Contract Address

Deploy the contract to preferred Ethereum-compatible network :
0xB627902729294383273419771153fBAFB7Aa1151

## Future Scope

1. **Enhanced Grading Algorithms**:
   - Develop advanced grading criteria and algorithms for more comprehensive assessments.

2. **Editable Submissions**:
   - Implement functionality to allow students to update or resubmit their homework before grading.

3. **Multi-Owner Functionality**:
   - Introduce role-based access or multi-signature mechanisms for improved governance and security.

4. **Integration with Educational Platforms**:
   - Integrate the contract with online learning platforms for seamless grading and rewards.

5. **Scalability Enhancements**:
   - Optimize the contract for better gas efficiency and performance on high-throughput networks.
